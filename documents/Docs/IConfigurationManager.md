## Overview
The `IConfigurationManager` interface defines the structure for managing configuration-related operations within the Flameborn SDK. This interface extends from the `IManager` interface, which is part of the core management system. The `IConfigurationManager` interface can be extended to include additional methods and properties specific to configuration management.

## Interface Definition

```csharp
using flameborn.Core.Managers.Abstract;

namespace flameborn.Sdk.Managers.Abstract
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Interface for managing configuration-related operations.
    /// </summary>
    public interface IConfigurationManager : IManager
    {
        // Additional methods and properties specific to configuration management can be added here.
    }
}
```

## Methods and Properties
The `IConfigurationManager` interface currently inherits all methods and properties from the `IManager` interface. Additional methods and properties specific to configuration management can be added to this interface as needed.

## Usage Example
Below is an example of how to implement the `IConfigurationManager` interface in a concrete class.

```csharp
using flameborn.Core.Managers.Abstract;
using flameborn.Sdk.Managers.Abstract;

namespace flameborn.Sdk.Managers
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Concrete implementation of the IConfigurationManager interface.
    /// </summary>
    public class ConfigurationManager : IConfigurationManager
    {
        // Implement the methods and properties of the IConfigurationManager interface here.
    }
}
```
